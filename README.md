# Mental Health Chatbot with RAG Model

## Project Overview
This project implements a **mental health chatbot** using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model. The chatbot is designed to provide accurate and context-aware responses by combining information retrieval with generative language modeling.

The RAG model enables the chatbot to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and generate natural language responses tailored to the user's queries. This approach improves the quality of diagnosis and advice related to mental health concerns.

## Key Features
- Retrieval of relevant knowledge snippets to enhance response accuracy
- Generation of contextual, natural language replies based on retrieved data
- Handling of user inputs related to mental health symptoms and feelings
- Designed for deployment in real-time chatbot applications

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers (RAG architecture)
- Streamlt(for frontend)
- FAISS
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up Python environment and install dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
3. Prepare the knowledge base dataset
4. Run the Flask backend server
5. Interact with the chatbot via the provided API or UI

## Future Work: Multi-Turn Mental Health Chatbot

This project is currently focused on single-turn interactions using the RAG model. Future improvements include:

- **Multi-turn conversation management:**  
  Enabling the chatbot to remember and contextually process multiple turns in a conversation for more natural and effective interactions.

- **Enhanced dialogue state tracking:**  
  Tracking user intent, sentiment, and conversation context over multiple exchanges.

- **Integration of NLP-based diagnostic models:**  
  Combining retrieval with fine-tuned NLP models to provide more precise mental health diagnosis and recommendations.

- **User personalization:**  
  Tailoring responses based on user history and preferences while ensuring privacy and data security.

- **Deployment improvements:**  
  Building a scalable and responsive web or mobile interface for real-time usage.
